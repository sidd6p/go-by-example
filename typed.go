/*
ðŸ’¡ Summary:

1. Go is a statically typed language â€” every variable has a type at compile time.
2. You can declare variables with explicit types (e.g., `var a int`) or let Go infer the type (e.g., `a := 10`).
3. Constants in Go are untyped by default and adapt to the type of the variable they are assigned to.
4. Channels, structs, arrays, etc., are always explicitly typed â€” you define what kind of data they work with.

The goal is to balance strict type safety with clean, readable code.
